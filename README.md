# Academic_research_agent
This project is an agentic AI system that autonomously retrieves and processes academic research papers from Google Scholar. It uses retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and AI reasoning to extract, summarize, and present relevant scholarly insights efficiently, making it valuable for academic research, literature reviews, and knowledge discovery.
